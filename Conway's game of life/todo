Bugs
====
Resume draw on mouse in after a mouse out while drawing. - Started in new branch.

autoConfigSize: height seems to be read before rendering complete -
                button text size bigger moved it down more.

Improvement
===========

Usability study notes
---------------------
Make slide action more obvious - arrow on slider, like bidirectional unlock?
Restrict slider end movement or at least add sufficient margin to allow for it
Attempted to drag resize grid.
Explain generation colours, possibly rename. Generation could mean
child is next colour, parent stays same.
Add a reference point / cursor?

Turn into a game.

Bigger close button.
Bigger checkbox. - Difficult, first attempt added though.

Sizing for iPod: Dynamically size settings dialog.

Get the tests sorted out. I have been experimenting with various
testing frameworks. I was using QUnit but did not like it. Not sorted
out better system yet. The tests also need refactored so generally
needs work.

QUnit bugs / enhancements noticed while using it for life:
      Only show diff if there is a difference!
      Option to print arb. data.
      Tap plan output.
      Option to suppress unwanted data dump.
      Catch errors in test - don't just let the whole thing die.

      Do something reasonable when stylesheet is not loaded. I found nothing happened and took
      ages to track down the bug.
